> ZJU course project, a billiard game based on libgraphcis
 
Actually I think it's a **PIECE OF SHIT**.

The total project structure is listed as follows: 

```
├─Custom Code
│  ├─Header
│  └─Source
├─Default
└─Project
    ├─.vs
    │  └─billiard
    ├─About
    ├─Data
    ├─Debug
    │  └─billiard.tlog
    ├─Music
    └─Release
        └─billiard.tlog

```

`Custom Code` contains the code of the project, `Default` contains the graphics library used. `Project` is a **VS** project, you can open it with Visual Studio or Consider to use `Custom Code`, `Default`, `About`, `Data`, `Music` to rebuild your own project.
