  The origin of snooker dates back to the second half of the 19th century.In the 1870s, billiards was popular am-
ong British Army officers stationed in Jubbulpore, India, and several variations of the game were devised during
this time. One version, which originated at the Officers' Mess of the 11th Devonshire Regiment in 1875, combin-
ed the rules of two pool games: pyramid pool, played with fifteen red-coloured balls positioned in a triangle; and
black pool, which involved the potting of designated balls. Snooker was further developed in 1882 when its first
set of rules was finalised by British Army officer Sir Neville Chamberlain, who helped devise and popularise the 
game at Stone House in Ootacamund on a table built by Burroughes & Watts that had been brought to India by 
boat. The word snooker was, at the time, a slang term used in the British Army to describe new recruits and inex-
perienced military personnel, and Chamberlain used it to deride the inferior performance of a young fellow offic-
er at the table.
  Snooker was given its first definite reference in England in an 1887 issue of the Sporting Life newspaper, which
led to a growth in popularity.
